	  <p>
	    Many businesses overlook the importance of having a solid marketing plan. There are four principles to marketing: product, price, place, promotion. Some people also include "packaging" in the list of marketing P's. Having a solid understanding of your service as it relates to each of these is crucial to forming new business and improving your services to stand out against the competition.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When working with Aero Agency on a strategic marketing plan, you will receive an unbiased analysis based on each of these principles. We will look at your products and services to form useful recommendations of how they could be improved to be more competitive and add more value to your customers. Additionally we can examine your operations to ensure efficiency. Price is paramount to the competitiveness of your product/service. We are familiar with industry standards and can provide a realistic recommendation in this area too. We will consider how your services relate to your local market and what can be done to make them more appealing to the market. Finally, we will form a plan to best utilize your promotional dollars to reach as many viewers in your target market as possible.

		  Marketing is so much more than just running advertisements. Marketing includes everything from evaluating the quality and value of your product, ensuring its price is competitive, making sure it’s “placed” in a market that needs it, and promoting it in an effective manner. Branding is to give your company an image. It’s not only a logo that makes your company memorable, but the consistency of your product, your name, and overall image. Marketing and branding are different, but they work together to grow your business.
